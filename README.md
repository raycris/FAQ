# Frequently Asked questions or FAQ
This project we implement a dark mode and translations between Spanish and English languages. In this project we'll see some logic about how to toggle state to make sure that each accordion opens and closes after each button press. You will also learn simple conditionals such as the and (&&) operator that will only show the content of the accordion when the accordion state says it is open.

Finally, we will create an entire FAQ (frequently asked questions) section by displaying multiple accordion components. To do so, we will learn how to pass each accordion's data down into the component using props.
